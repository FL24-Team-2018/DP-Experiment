To avoid strong absorption of the {EUV} radiation in a residual gas present in the chamber during the source operation a two step differential pumping system was employed. The system allows for polymer processing under relatively high vacuum conditions (10−5 mbar) or in a reactive gas atmosphere. Polymer samples can be irradiated in a focal plane of the {EUV} collector or at some distance downstream the focal plane.

  abstract  = { ABSTRACT In this work, a laser-produced plasma extreme ultraviolet source and a free electron laser were used to create Ne photo-ionized plasmas. In both cases, a radiation beam was focused onto a gas stream injected into a vacuum chamber synchronously with the radiation pulse. Extreme ultraviolet radiation from the plasma spanned a wide spectral range with pronounced maximum centered at λ = 11 ± 1 nm while the free electron laser pulses were emitted at a wavelength of 32 nm. The power density of the focused plasma radiation was approximately 2 × 107 W/cm2 and was seven orders of magnitude lower compared with the focused free electron laser beam. Radiation fluences in both experimental conditions were comparable. Despite quite different spectral characteristics and extremely different power densities, emission spectra of both photo-ionized plasmas consist of the same spectral lines within a wavelength range of 20 to 50 nm, however, with different relative intensities of the corresponding lines. The dominating spectral lines originated from singly charged ions (Ne II); however, Ne III lines were also detected. Additionally, computer simulations of the emission spectra, obtained for photo-ionized plasmas, driven by the plasma extreme ultraviolet source, were performed. The corresponding measured and calculated spectra are presented. An electron temperature and ionic composition were estimated. Differences between the experimental spectra, obtained for both irradiation conditions, were analyzed. The differences were attributed mainly to different energies of driving photons. },

In this work photoionized plasmas were created by irradiation of He, Ne and Ar gases with a focused EUV beam from one of two laser-plasma sources employing Nd:YAG laser systems of different parameters. First of them was a 10-Hz laser-plasma EUV source, based on a double-stream gas-puff target, irradiated with the 3-ns/0.8J laser pulse. EUV radiation in this case was focused using a gold-plated grazing incidence ellipsoidal collector in the wavelength range λ = 9÷70 nm. The most intense emission was in the relatively narrow spectral region centred at λ = 11 ± 1 nm. The second source was based on a 10 ns/10 J/10 Hz laser system. In this case EUV radiation was focused using a gold-plated grazing incidence multifoil collector or a Mo-coated ellipsoidal collector. The most intense emission in this case was in the 5 ÷ 15 nm spectral region. Radiation fluence ranged from 60 mJ/cm2 to 400 mJ/cm2. Different gases were injected into the interaction region, perpendicularly to an optical axis of the irradiation system, using an auxiliary gas puff valve. Irradiation of the gases resulted in ionization and excitation of atoms and ions. Spectra in EUV range were measured using a grazing incidence, flat-field spectrometer (McPherson Model 251), equipped with a 450 lines/mm toroidal grating. In all cases the most intense emission lines were assigned to singly charged ions. The other emission lines belong to atoms or doubly charged ions. The spectra were excited in low density gases of the order of 1 ÷ 10% atmospheric density.

  abstract  = {In this work a review of investigations concerning interaction of intense extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and soft X-ray (SXR) pulses with matter is presented. The investigations were performed using laser-produced plasma (LPP) EUV/SXR sources based on a double stream gas puff target. The sources are equipped with dedicated collectors allowing for efficient focusing of the EUV/SXR radiation pulses. Intense radiation in a wide spectral range, as well as a quasi-monochromatic radiation can be produced. In the paper different kinds of LPP EUV/SXR sources developed in the Institute of Optoelectronics, Military University of Technology are described.

Radiation intensities delivered by the sources are sufficient for different kinds of interaction experiments including EUV/SXR induced ablation, surface treatment, EUV fluorescence or photoionized plasma creation. A brief review of the main results concerning this kind of experiments performed by author of the paper are presented. However, since the LPP sources cannot compete with large scale X-ray sources like synchrotrons, free electron lasers or high energy density plasma sources, it was indicated that some investigations not requiring extreme irradiation parameters can be performed using the small scale installations. Some results, especially concerning low temperature photoionized plasmas are very unique and could be hardly obtained using the large facilities.},

Two different laser-produced plasma sources, employing a low energy Nd:YAG laser and a high energy iodine laser system (PALS), were used for creation of photoionized plasmas. In both cases the EUV or SXR beam irradiated the Ar stream, injected into a vacuum chamber synchronously with the radiation pulse. Emission spectra, measured for the Ar photoionized plasmas indicated strong differences in ionization degree for plasmas produced using low and high energy systems. In case of the the EUV driving pulses, emission lines corresponding to neutral atoms and singly charged ions were observed. In case of the SXR pulses utilized for the photoionized plasma creation, only Ar V–VIII emission lines were recorded. Additionally, electron density measurements were performed by laser interferometry employing a femtosecond laser system synchronized with the irradiating system. Maximum electron density for the Ar photoionized plasma, induced using the high energy system, reached 1.9 · 10 18 cm −3 . Interferometric measurements performed for the moment of maximum intensity of the main laser pulse ( t   =  0) revealed no fringe shift. Detection limit for the interferometric measurements was estimated. It allowed to estimate the upper limit for electron density at t   =  0 as 5 · 10 16 cm −3 .},

Much effort has been invested in predicting and modeling the XFEL photon source properties at the undulator exit; however, as most LCLS experiments are ultimately dependent on the beam focal spot properties it is equally as important to understand the XFEL beam at the endstations where the experiments are performed. Here, we use newly available precision surface metrology data from actual LCLS mirrors combined with a scalar diffraction model to predict the LCLS beam properties in the experiment chambers.},

The Laser-Laboratorium Göttingen e.V. has developed a laser-driven plasma source for generation of soft X-rays in the spectral range 2...20 nm. A Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 800 mJ, 6 ns) is focused into a gas-target leading to plasma formation which in turn emits characteristic soft X-ray radiation. Depending on the employed target gas, narrow-band as well as broad-band spectra can be obtained. For focusing a Kirkpatrick-Baez optics is used, providing broad-band light steering due to grazing-incidence reflection. The mirrors of the arrangement are formed by bent silicon wafer slices allowing continuous tuning to the desired curvatures. The motorized control offers active adaption of surface shape and incidence angles even in high vacuum, to various experimental demands (e.g. focusing on different sites, beam collimation). For reduction of aberrations the optical system was fine-adjusted with the help of a Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor in the visible spectral range. The wave propagation properties were determined and compared to calculations performed with ZEMAX. From the difference between calculated phase and measured wavefront direct information about the figure error between perfect and real mirrors could be obtained.},

The Laser-Laboratorium GÃÂ¶ttingen has developed a laser-driven plasma source for generation of soft X-rays in the spectral range 2...20 nm. A Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 800 mJ, 6 ns) is focused into a gas-target leading to the formation of a plasma which in turn emits characteristic soft X-ray radiation. Hereby the main focus lies on wavelengths around 13.5 nm ("EUV" - future optical lithography) and the so called water window (2.2 nm...4.4 nm - "XUV") region. Depending on the employed target gas, narrow-band (e.g. O2 for EUV, N2 for XUV) as well as broad-band (e.g. Xe for EUV, Ar, Kr for XUV) spectra can be obtained. For focusing a flexible Kirkpatrick-Baez optics was developed, providing broad-band light steering due to grazing-incidence reflection. The carbon-coated mirrors of this device are formed by bent silicon wafer slices allowing continuous tuning to the desired curvatures. As an application of such a setup, results on near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (NEXAFS) at the carbon K-edge will be presented. The investigated systems range from synthetic polymers (PMMA, PI) over organic substances (humic acids) to biological matter (lipids), delivering unique spectra for each compound. Thus NEXAFS spectroscopy using a table-top XUV source could be established as a highly surface sensitive fingerprint method for chemical analysis.},

  abstract  = {In contrast to vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) and deep ultraviolet (DUV) light used for current lithography technologies, extreme UV (EUV) light with a wavelength of 13.5 nm is strongly absorbed by any material. Optical coatings for infrared (IR), visible, and UV light are predominantly fabricated by thermal or electron beam evaporation. The fabrication of such demanding nanometer multilayers needed, for instance, for EUV lithography is only possible if accurate metrology tools are routinely available which enable the immediate inspection of the layer properties. One of the most powerful techniques for the characterization of EUV and X-ray reflection coatings is reflectometry. The steady power increase of EUV sources results not only in higher EUV intensities but also in stronger heating of the optical components. One promising approach for hard X-ray focusing which has arisen in recent years is the concept of multilayer Laue lenses (MLLs).},

Advanced X-ray spatial and temporal metrology
Soft 0.03 -1 keV and hard X-rays 1 -100 keV are one of the best tools for probing matter from the macroscopic to
the atomic scale thanks to their penetrating power, spectral selectivity and ability to achieve single atom image.
Apart from scientific applications, X-rays are everywhere in our daily life, from medicine, security, food safety,
environment and cultural heritage.

Ultra-intense X-ray free-electron lasers, plasma-based soft X-ray lasers and attosecond high harmonics have
strongly changed the X-ray paradigm. Demands on optics and beam metrology are outstripping the conventional
X-ray metrology pulled by synchrotron, EUV lithography and solar telescopes.

This COST Action MP1203 will bring together and consolidate a huge infrastructural and facility rich consortium of
hundreds of PIs, ERs and ESRs. New synergies between the different groups will induce strong and fast progress
in X-ray metrology. Firms and standardization laboratories are well involved. This Action will improve public and
private researchers career at all stages, by increasing mobility and exchange. Short Term Scientific Mission

Advanced X-ray spatial and temporal metrology
Soft 0.03 -1 keV and hard X-rays 1 -100 keV are one of the best tools for probing matter from the macroscopic to
the atomic scale thanks to their penetrating power, spectral selectivity and ability to achieve single atom image.
Apart from scientific applications, X-rays are everywhere in our daily life, from medicine, security, food safety,
environment and cultural heritage.

Ultra-intense X-ray free-electron lasers, plasma-based soft X-ray lasers and attosecond high harmonics have
strongly changed the X-ray paradigm. Demands on optics and beam metrology are outstripping the conventional
X-ray metrology pulled by synchrotron, EUV lithography and solar telescopes.

This COST Action MP1203 will bring together and consolidate a huge infrastructural and facility rich consortium of
hundreds of PIs, ERs and ESRs. New synergies between the different groups will induce strong and fast progress
in X-ray metrology. Firms and standardization laboratories are well involved. This Action will improve public and
private researchers career at all stages, by increasing mobility and exchange. Short Term Scientific Mission

We measure the energy per pulse and per harmonic, the energy jitter, the divergence and the position stability of the harmonic beam. We perform ab initio numerical simulations based on integration of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and of the wave equation within the slowly varying envelope approximation. The results reproduce the experimental measurements to better than a factor of two. The interaction of a frequency comb of harmonic fields with an electron bunch in an undulator is examined with a simple model consisting of calculating the energy modulation owing to the seed–electron interaction. The model indicates that the undulator acts as a spectral filter selecting a given harmonic.},

The device is adapted to the characteristics of the Free-electron LASer in Hamburg (FLASH). It operates in a wavelength range from 6 to 30 nm with the capability to measure the wavefront quality of individual free-electron laser (FEL) pulses for beam characterization as well as for beamline alignment and monitoring behind user experiments. We report on online-Hartmann wavefront measurements at beamline BL2 with λ 13.5 nm /90 accuracy for wavefront rms ( w rms ). The results were used to align the ellipsoidal focusing mirror at the beamline, decreasing the residual root mean square (rms) wavefront aberrations by more than a factor of 3 to 2.6 nm. The spot size of 31 μm ( x ) and 27 μm ( y ) full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) as well as other beam parameters evaluated from wavefront and intensity data are consistent with independent profile measurements in the focal region, employing both a high-resolution EUV camera and poly(methyl metacrylate) (PMMA) imprints.},

In extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the EUV mask, which has an absorber layer and a Mo/Si multilayer on a glass substrate, strongly affects the EUV phase. EUV actinic metrology is required to evaluate the feature of defect printability and the critical dimension (CD) value. The 3D structure modulates the EUV phase, causing the pattern position and focus shift. A microscope that observes in phase contrast necessary. We have developed a coherent EUV scatterometry microscope (CSM) for observing EUV patterns with quantitative phase contrast. The exposure light is coherent EUV light. For the industrial use, we have developed a laboratory coherent source of high-harmonic-generation (HHG) EUV light. High harmonics is pumped by a scale of a Ti:Sapphire laser. In the previous study, a very long exposure time of 1000 s was necessary to detect We upgraded the relay optics. The detection performance of an absorber defect using the new relay optics is We observed the line-end oversize defect and the oversize defect in the 112 nm hole pattern and 180 nm hole pattern. The upgraded system has a detection size limit of a line-end 24-nm-oversize defect with 10 s exposure time, which is 2,688 nm2 (52 Ã— 52 nm2) absorber defect. This result shows high performance capability of HHG-CSM for detecting small defect.

  abstract  = { ConspectusPolypyridyl transition-metal complexes are an intriguing class of compounds due to the relatively facile chemical designs and variations in ligand-field strengths that allow for spin-state changes and hence electronic configurations in response to external perturbations such as pressure and light. Light-activated spin-conversion complexes have possible applications in a variety of molecular-based devices, and ultrafast excited-state evolution in these complexes is of fundamental interest for understanding of the origins of spin-state conversion in metal complexes. Knowledge of the interplay of structure and valence charge distributions is important to understand which degrees of freedom drive spin-conversion and which respond in a favorable (or unfavorable) manner.To track the response of the constituent components, various types of time-resolved X-ray probe methods have been utilized for a broad range of chemical and biological systems relevant to catalysis, solar energy conversions, and functional molecular devices. In particular, transient soft X-ray spectroscopy of solvated molecules can offer complementary information on the detailed electronic structures and valence charge distributions of photoinduced intermediate species: First-row transition-metal L-edges consist of 2pâ€“3d transitions, which directly probe the unoccupied valence density of states and feature lifetime broadening in the range of 100 meV, making them sensitive spectral probes of metalâ€“ligand interactions.In this Account, we present some of our recent progress in employing picosecond and femtosecond soft X-ray pulses from synchrotron sources to investigate element specific valence charge distributions and spin-state evolutions in Fe(II) polypyridyl complexes via core-level transitions. Our results on transient L-edge spectroscopy of Fe(II) complexes clearly show that the reduction in Ïƒ-donation is compensated by significant attenuation of Ï€-backbonding upon spin-crossover. This underscores the important information contained in transient metal L-edge spectroscopy on changes in the 3d orbitals including oxidation states, orbital symmetries, and covalency, which largely define the chemistry of these complexes. In addition, ligand K-edge spectroscopy reveals the â€œligand viewâ€� of the valence charge density by probing 1sâ€“2p core-level transitions at the K-edge of light elements such as nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen. In the case of Fe(II) spin-conversion complexes, additional details of the metalâ€“ligand interactions can be obtained by this type of X-ray spectroscopy. With new initiatives in and construction of X-ray free-electron laser sources, we expect time-resolved soft X-ray spectroscopy to pave a new way to study electronic and molecular dynamics of functional materials, thereby answering many interesting scientific questions in inorganic chemistry and material science. },

This paper provides a full description of the facility in terms of laser performance, target systems and diagnostics currently available. Inevitably, this is a snapshot of current capabilityâ€”the available diagnostics and the laser capability are evolving continuously. The laser systems consist of ten beams, optimised around 1â€‰ns pulse duration, which each provide a nominal 500â€‰J at a wavelength of 351â€‰nm. There are also two short pulse beams, which each provide 500â€‰J in 0.5â€‰ps at 1054â€‰nm. There are options for frequency doubling one short pulse beam to enhance the pulse temporal contrast. More recently, further contrast enhancement, based on optical parametric amplification (OPA) in the front end with a pump pulse duration of a few ps, has been installed. An extensive suite of diagnostics are available for users, probing the optical emission, x-rays and particles produced in laser-target interactions. Optical probe diagnostics are also available. A description of the diagnostics is provided.},

  abstract  = {BL13-XALOC is currently the only macromolecular crystallography beamline at the 3GeV ALBA synchrotron near Barcelona, Spain. The optics design is based on an in-vacuum undulator, a Si(111) channel-cut crystal monochromator and a pair of KB mirrors. It allows three main operation modes: a focused configuration, where both mirrors can focus the beam at the sample position to 52{$\mu$}m {$\times$} 5.5{$\mu$}m FWHM (H {$\times$} V); a defocused configuration that can match the size of the beam to the dimensions of the crystals or to focus the beam at the detector; and an unfocused configuration, where one or both mirrors are removed from the photon beam path. To achieve a uniform defocused beam, the slope errors of the mirrors were reduced down to 55nrad RMS by employing a novel method that has been developed at the ALBA high-accuracy metrology laboratory. Thorough commissioning with X-ray beam and user operation has demonstrated an excellent energy and spatial stability of the beamline. The end-station includes a high-accuracy single-axis diffractometer, a removable mini-kappa stage, an automated sample-mounting robot and a photon-counting detector that allows shutterless operation. The positioning tables of the diffractometer and the detector are based on a novel and highly stable design. This equipment, together with the operation flexibility of the beamline, allows a large variety of types of crystals to be tackled, from medium-sized crystals with large unit-cell parameters to microcrystals. Several examples of data collections measured during beamline commissioning are described. The beamline started user operation on 18 July 2012.},

The same optical tool was first demonstrated on a quasi stationnary state (QSS) soft X-Ray laser at the \{PALS\} Institute in Prague. The problem set by the transient soft X-Ray laser developed by the \{LIXAM\} at the \{LULI\} installation in Palaiseau is more crucial, first because the beam spatial profile is more irregular secondly because high repetition rate soft X-ray laser facilities in the future are based on this \{SXRL\} type. The spots obtained show a 20 micron average diameter and a rather homogeneous and smooth profile that make them a realistic irradiation source to interact with targets requiring relatively high fluence (near 1 J/cm2) or intensity (near 1011 W/cm2) in the extreme \{UV\} domain. },

To achieve a high degree of the accuracy in the controllability of a curved line, a Fizeau interferometer is placed in front of the mirror surface to monitor its shape in the experiment.

Additionally, the spatial phase is measured with an XUV wavefront sensor for a single HH order measured in a single shot, which according to our knowledge was not reported before with a Hartmann wavefront sensor. Furthermore, we compare the single-shot measurement of the spatial phase with time-integrated measurements and we show that the XUV wavefront sensor is a useful tool to simultaneously optimize the spatial phase and intensity of HHG within the available HHG parameter range used in this study.},

Here, we focused on a table-top soft–X-ray source, which fulfils these fundamental criteria and in addition presents high temporal coherence, the high harmonics generated with a two-colour field (ω+2ω). These harmonics revealed to be free from aberration just by slightly spatially filtering the laser used for generation (ω). Indeed, the measured wavefront distortions, equal to λ/17 RMS at 44 nm, correspond to a diffraction-limited beam. This behaviour is explained by an additional spatial nonlinear filtering effect of the driving laser wavefront, induced here in our particular but simple geometrical configuration of generation by the 2ω component.},

Grazing-incidence optics for X-ray applications require extremely smooth surfaces with precise mirror figures to provide well focused beams and small image spot sizes for astronomical telescopes and laboratory test facilities. The required precision has traditionally been achieved by time-consuming grinding and polishing of thick substrates with frequent pauses for precise metrology to check the mirror figure. More recently, substrates with high quality surface finish and figures have become available at reasonable cost, and techniques have been developed to mechanically adjust the figure of these traditionally polished substrates for ground-based applications. The beam-bending techniques currently in use are mechanically complex, however, with little control over mid-spatial frequency errors. AOA-Xinetics has been developing been developing techniques for shaping grazing incidence optics with surface-normal and surface-parallel electrostrictive Lead magnesium niobate (PMN) actuators bonded to mirror substrates for several years. These actuators are highly reliable; exhibit little to no hysteresis, aging or creep; and can be closely spaced to correct low and mid-spatial frequency errors in a compact package. In this paper we discuss recent development of adaptive x-ray optics at AOA-Xinetics.

With this setup we have investigated the influence of typical adjustable parameters such as gas pressure and focal position as well as the spatial laser beam profile on the conversion efficiency and the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) beam profile. Independent of the control parameter we always observed the highest conversion efficiency in connection with the best beam profile, i.e. the highest flux corresponds also to the highest brilliance. Furthermore, we have shown that aberrations of the fundamental laser beam are not simply imprinted onto the XUV beam.},

  abstract  = {Lens heating due to absorbed {UV} laser radiation can diminish the achievable spatial resolution of the lithographic process in semiconductor wafer steppers. At the Laser Lab G\"{o}ttingen a measurement system for quantitative registration of this thermal lens effect was developed. It is based upon a strongly improved Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor with extreme sensitivity, accomplishing precise on-line monitoring of wavefront deformations of a collimated test laser beam transmitted through the laser-irradiated site of a sample. Caused by the temperature-dependent refractive index as well as thermal expansion, the formerly plane wavefront of the test laser is distorted to form a rotationally symmetric valley, being equivalent to a convex lens. The new sensor, which is capable to record relative changes in the range of Î»/10000 (corresponding to deformations of {\textless} 100 pm), allows registration and precise characterization of induced wavefront distortions by real-time Zernike analysis. On the other hand, the photo-thermal technique can be employed for a rapid assessment of the material quality, since the extent of transient wavefront deformation is directly proportional to the absorption losses. When used in orthogonal test geometry on cuboid samples, quantitative determination of both surface and bulk contributions to the overall absorption can be obtained by comparison with thermal theory. Along with a description of the new technique we present photo-thermal measurements on various fused silica samples under 193 nm irradiation. The data are compared with theoretical results obtained from a semi-analytical solution of the heat diffusion equation. Excellent agreement is achieved regarding both shape and extent of the lens heating effect.},

The reference wave front needed to calibrate the sensor was generated by spatially filtering a focused undulator beam with 1.7- and 0.6-$\mu$m -diameter pinholes. To fully characterize the sensor, accuracy and sensitivity measurements were performed. The incident beam's wavelength was varied from 7 to 25 nm. Measurements of accuracy better than $\lambda$EUV/120 (0.11 nm) were obtained at $\lambda$EUV$=$13.4 nm . The aberrations introduced by an additional thin mirror, as well as wave front of the spatially unfiltered incident beam, were also measured.},

Its radius of curvature can be adjusted from infinity down to 50 m, with residual slope errors in correction less than 0.6 μrad RMS over a 300 mm useful length. A dedicated X-ray Hartmann wavefront sensor, based on YAG:Ce wavelength conversion to visible light, was developed for feedback control of the mirror.

 We demonstrate a comprehensive and broadly applicable methodology for the optimal in situ configuration of bendable soft x-ray Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors. The mirrors used for this application are preset at the Advanced Light Source Optical Metrology Laboratory prior to beamline installation. The in situ methodology consists of a new technique for simultaneously setting the height and pitch angle of each mirror. The benders of both mirrors were then optimally tuned in order to minimize ray aberrations to a level below the diffraction-limited beam waist size of 200  nm (horizontal)×100  nm (vertical). After applying this methodology, we measured a beam waist size of 290  nm (horizontal)×130  nm (vertical) with 1 nm light using the Foucault knife-edge test. We also discuss the utility of using a grating-based lateral shearing interferometer with quantitative wavefront feedback for further improvement of bendable optics.},

  abstract  = {Mirrors are key devices for creating various systems in optics. Focusing X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light requires mirror surfaces with an extremely high accuracy. The figure of an ellipsoidal mirror is obtained by rotating an elliptical profile, and using such a mirror, soft X-ray and EUV light can be focused to dimensions on the order of nanometers without chromatic aberration. Although the theoretical performance of ellipsoidal mirrors is extremely high, the fabrication of an ideal ellipsoidal mirror remains problematic. Based on this background, we have been working to develop a fabrication system for ellipsoidal mirrors. In this proceeding, we briefly introduce the fabrication process and the soft X-ray focusing performance of the ellipsoidal mirror fabricated using the proposed process.},

The distortion of the XRL wave-front caused by the gradients of the electron density is measured using Talbot pattern deformation. The plasma probed by the XRL is imaged on the CCD plane, then a 2D grating is put in front of the chip so that the Talbot plane of this grating fits on the CCD. The compromise between the spatial resolution and the sensitivity for the given wavelength of the probe must be set within the grating design. The main advantages of this method are low requirements on spatial coherence of the probing beam as well as the simple alignment, which are the main difficulties of interferometry using radiation of XRLs.},

  abstract  = {Beamline mirrors and a monochromator were developed as key optical devices for the Japanese \{XFEL\} facility, SPring-8 Ã…ngstrom Compact Free Electron Laser (SACLA). The optics were designed for transporting extremely intense, transversely coherent \{XFEL\} light to the experimental stations. The mirror system delivers a pink beam with high intensity and an energy range below 15 keV, while the monochromator with Si (1 1 1) covers wider energy range of 4â€“30 keV with 0.01% bandwidth. For realizing high stability and contamination-free environment, the mechanics of these optical components were designed to have high stiffness with ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatibility. After 100 days of operation, no radiation damage was observed on the mirror surfaces. },

  abstract     = {{FERMI}@Elettra, the first seeded {EUV}-{SXR} free electron laser ({FEL}) facility located at Elettra Sincrotrone Trieste has been conceived to provide very short (10â€“100 fs) pulses with ultrahigh peak brightness and wavelengths from 100 nm to 4 nm. A section fully dedicated to the photon transport and analysis diagnostics, named {PADReS}, has already been installed and commissioned. Three of the beamlines, {EIS}-{TIMEX}, {DiProI} and {LDM}, installed after the {PADReS} section, are in advanced commissioning state and will accept the first users in December 2012. These beam lines employ active X-ray optics in order to focus the {FEL} beam as well as to perform a controlled beam-shaping at focus.

Starting from mirror surface metrology characterization, it is difficult to predict the focal spot shape applying only methods based on geometrical optics such as the ray tracing. Within the geometrical optics approach one cannot take into account the diffraction effect from the optics edges, i.e. the aperture diffraction, and the impact of different surface spatial wavelengths to the spot size degradation. Both these effects are strongly dependent on the photon beam energy and mirror incident angles.

We employed a method based on physical optics, which applies the Huygensâ€“Fresnel principle to reflection (on which the {WISE} code is based). In this work we report the results of the first measurements of the focal spot in the {DiProI} beamline end-station and compare them to the predictions computed with Shadow code and {WISE} code, starting from the mirror surface profile characterization.},

Absolute time-integrated and relative time-dependent transmission measurements indicate significant differences with cold opacity data, due to the heating, leading to partially ionized states with temperatures of 0.5–20 eV. The transmission data are compared with simulations that qualitatively reproduce the time-dependent transmission measurements and demonstrate the importance of including detailed atomic absorption processes in the warm dense matter regime. },

  abstract   = {To enhance the reflectivity of X-ray mirrors beyond the critical angle, multilayer coatings are required. Interface imperfections in the multilayer growth process are known to cause non-specular scattering and degrade the mirror optical performance; therefore, it is important to predict the amount of X-ray scattering from the rough topography of the outer surface of the coating, which can be directly measured, e.g., with an Atomic Force Microscope ({AFM}). This kind of characterization, combined with X-ray reflectivity measurements to assess the deep multilayer stack structure, can be used to model the layer roughening during the growth process via a well-known roughness evolution model. In this work, X-ray scattering measurements are performed and compared with simulations obtained from the modeled interfacial Power Spectral Densities ({PSDs}) and the modeled Crossed Spectral Densities for all the couples of interfaces. We already used this approach in a previous work for periodic multilayers; we now show how this method can be extended to graded multilayers. The upgraded code is validated for both periodic and graded multilayers, with a good accord between experimental data and model findings. Doing this, different kinds of defects observed in {AFM} scans are included in the {PSD} analysis. The subsequent data-model comparison enables us to recognize them as surface contamination or interfacial defects that contribute to the X-ray scattering of the multilayer.},

  abstract  = {X-ray mirrors with high focusing performances are in use in both mirror modules for X-ray telescopes and in synchrotron and \{FEL\} (Free Electron Laser) beamlines. A degradation of the focus sharpness arises in general from geometrical deformations and surface roughness, the former usually described by geometrical optics and the latter by physical optics. In general, technological developments are aimed at a very tight focusing, which requires the mirror profile to comply with the nominal shape as much as possible and to keep the roughness at a negligible level. However, a deliberate deformation of the mirror can be made to endow the focus with a desired size and distribution, via piezo actuators as done at the EIS-TIMEX beamline of FERMI@Elettra. The resulting profile can be characterized with a Long Trace Profilometer and correlated with the expected optical quality via a wavefront propagation code. However, if the roughness contribution can be neglected, the computation can be performed via a ray-tracing routine, and, under opportune assumptions, the focal spot profile (the Point Spread Function, PSF) can even be predicted analytically. The advantage of this approach is that the analytical relation can be reversed; i.e., from the desired \{PSF\} the required mirror profile can be computed easily, thereby avoiding the use of complex and time-consuming numerical codes. The method can also be suited in the case of spatially inhomogeneous beam intensities, as commonly experienced at synchrotrons and FELs. In this work we expose the analytical method and the application to the beam shaping problem.},

We have developed a EUV scatterometer using a focused high-order harmonic generation (HHG) source for nano-scale
grating measurement. The coherent light source with multiple discrete wavelengths of 25-35 nm was pumped by a
tabletop Ti:sapphire laser system. A charge-couple-device (CCD) camera directly records the diffraction image of the
zero and the first order diffraction information from the grating samples. The grating structure can be reconstructed base
on the calculations from the location and the intensity distribution of diffraction pattern.

Simultaneous near diffraction-limited focusability is achieved for both the fundamental (800 nm) and second harmonic (400 nm) of Ti:sapphire-amplified laser light. By comparing the relative effectiveness of various correction loops, the optimal ones are found. Simultaneous correction of both beams of different color relies on the linear proportionality between their wavefront aberrations. This method can enable two-color experiments at relativistic intensities.},

The instrument is based on an edge-polished mirror design covering an energy range of 250 eV-1800 eV and producing a delay between the two split pulses variable up to 400 femtoseconds with a sub-100 attosecond resolution. We present experimental and simulation results regarding molecular dissociation dynamics in CH3I and CO probed by the XRSD device. We observed ion kinetic energy and branching ratio dependence on the delay times which were reliably produced by the XRSD instrument.},

  abstract  = {Optical elements of soft x-ray beamlines usually have motorized translations and rotations that allow for the fine alignment of the beamline. This is to steer the photon beam at some positions and to correct the focus on slits or on sample. Generally, each degree of freedom of a mirror induces a change of several parameters of the beam. Inversely, several motions are required to actuate on a single optical parameter, keeping the others unchanged. We define optical pseudomotors as combinations of physical motions of the optical elements of a beamline, which allow modifying one optical parameter without affecting the others. We describe a method to obtain analytic relationships between physical motions of mirrors and the corresponding variations of the beam parameters. This method has been implemented and tested at two beamlines at ALBA, where it is used to control the focus of the photon beam and its position independently.},

The intensity stability is measured for each high-harmonic (HH) order with a spectrometer. Additionally, the spatial phase is measured with an XUV wavefront sensor for a single HH order measured in a single shot, which according to our knowledge was not reported before with a Hartmann wavefront sensor. Furthermore, we compare the single-shot measurement of the spatial phase with time-integrated measurements and we show that the XUV wavefront sensor is a useful tool to simultaneously optimize the spatial phase and intensity of HHG within the available HHG parameter range used in this study.},

The investigation of the beam profile near the interaction region shows that the optimized beam is asymmetric and has a larger diameter. Thus, the optimized beam leads to a higher yield even if the peak intensity is lower compared to an unoptimized beam. This indicates that the wavefront of the fundamental laser beam and, accordingly, the focal profile play an important role in the efficient generation of high-order harmonic radiation.},

The branching ratio of the dissociative photoionization of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) can be maximized and minimized by applying tailored soft-x-ray femtosecond light fields. The spectrally shaped coherent soft-x-ray pulses are produced by high-harmonic generation driven by phase-shaped femtosecond laser pulses. The stability of the shaped high-harmonic output is high enough to perform adaptive control experiments, albeit its strong nonlinear dependence on the driving laser pulse shape. This experiment opens the door to the application of pulse-shaping and coherent-control techniques in the soft-x-ray range.},

  abstract  = {Implementing the plasma-lasing potential for tabletop nano-imaging on across a hot plasma medium drives short-wavelength lasing, promising for ``turnkey'' nano-imaging setups. A systematic study of the illumination characteristics, combined with design-adapted objectives, is presented. It is shown how the ultimate nano-scale feature is dictated by either the diffraction-limited or the wavefront-limited resolution, which imposed a combined study of both the source and the optics. For nano-imaging, the spatial homogeneity of the illumination (spot noise) was shown as critical. Plasma-lasing from a triple grazing-incidence pumping scheme compensated for the missing spot homogeneity in classical schemes. We demonstrate that a collimating mirror pre-conditions both the pointing stability and the divergence below half a mrad.},

  abstract  = {The experimental characterization of the spatial and temporal coherence properties of the free-electron laser in Hamburg (FLASH) at a wavelength of 8.0 nm is presented. Double pinhole diffraction patterns of single femtosecond pulses focused to a size of about 10{\texttimes}10 $\mu$m2 were measured. A transverse coherence length of 6.2 {\textpm} 0.9 $\mu$m in the horizontal and 8.7 {\textpm} 1.0 $\mu$m in the vertical direction was determined from the most coherent pulses. Using a split and delay unit the coherence time of the pulses produced in the same operation conditions of FLASH was measured to be 1.75 {\textpm} 0.01 fs. From our experiment we estimated the degeneracy parameter of the FLASH beam to be on the order of 1010 to 1011, which exceeds the values of this parameter at any other source in the same energy range by many orders of magnitude.},

  abstract  = {The concept of coherence is widely used in different areas of physics like in optics, in quantum optics or in neutron and X-ray scattering, however with subtle differences in meaning for the different communities. In quantum optics it is mainly the source of photons and its characterization in terms of coherence functions which is of concern. In a scattering experiment, on the other hand, the source is supposed to be characterized and it is the internal degrees of freedom of the sample which are studied via their influence on the detected interference pattern. It is one of the purposes of this paper to clarify the different concepts and to show how they are interrelated. The paper is organized as follows. First, we will discuss what interferes in a physical event. This will be treated according to the Feynman formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of probability amplitudes and we will describe nine rules on how to calculate with these amplitudes. Then we will discuss what destroys interference. The main part of the paper treats a number of applications from quantum optics and X-ray and neutron scattering. These include quantum beats, Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry, entangled states, Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen paradox and speckle from coherently illuminated samples. },

It is shown that the XFEL radiation before saturation is described with Gaussian statistics. Particularly important is the case of the optimized XFEL studied in detail. Applying similarity techniques to the results of numerical simulations allowed us to find universal scaling relations for the main characteristics of an XFEL operating in the saturation regime: efficiency, coherence time and degree of transverse coherence. We find that with an appropriate normalization of these quantities, they are functions of only the ratio of the geometrical emittance of the electron beam to the radiation wavelength. Statistical and coherence properties of the higher harmonics of the radiation are highlighted as well.},

The aim is to provide newcomers to the area with insights into: the basic physics of FELs, the qualities of the radiation they produce, the challenges of transmitting that radiation to end users and the diversity of current scientific applications. Initial consideration is given to FEL theory in order to provide the foundation for discussion of FEL output properties and the technical challenges of short-wavelength FELs. This is followed by an overview of existing x-ray FEL facilities, future facilities and FEL frontiers. To provide a context for information in the above sections, a detailed comparison of the photon pulse characteristics of FEL sources with those of other sources of high brightness x-rays is made. A brief summary of FEL beamline design and photon diagnostics then precedes an overview of FEL scientific applications. Recent highlights are covered in sections on structural biology, atomic and molecular physics, photochemistry, non-linear spectroscopy, shock physics, solid density plasmas. A short industrial perspective is also included to emphasise potential in this area.},

  abstract    = {By experimentally studying high-order harmonic beams generated in gases, we show how the spatial characteristics of these ultrashort XUV beams can be finely controlled under standard generation conditions. For the first time, we demonstrate that these XUV beams can be emitted as converging beams and get thereby focused after generation. We study this mirrorless focusing using a spatially chirped beam that acts as a spatially localized probe located inside the harmonic generation medium. We analyze the XUV beam evolution with an analytical model providing the beam characteristics and obtain very good agreement with experimental measurements. The XUV foci sizes and positions vary strongly with the harmonic order and the XUV waist can be located at arbitrarily large distances from the generating medium. We discuss how intense XUV fields can be obtained with mirrorless focusing and how such order-dependent XUV beam characteristics are compatible with broadband XUV irradiation and attosecond science.},

  abstract  = {The free-electron laser FLASH2, a variable gap undulators line, has opened new scientific possibilities for users at DESY in the Hamburg area [1]. The current pulsed radiation at the FLASH facility primarily relies on the SASE process. Thus, the beam characteristics may differ drastically from pulse to pulse; requiring single-shot photon diagnostics and characterization of the photon beam parameters. The beamline FL24 at FLASH2 is equipped with a set of bendable Kirkpatrick-Baez (KB) mirrors which can strongly focus the beam down to a few micrometers. As a key parameter for many experiments, understanding of the focus characteristics and variations is demanded by users. The current instrumentation at the beamline FL24 has foreseen a dedicated Hartmann-Wavefront Sensor (HWS) to run the online, highly focused, single-shot beam characterization within the operating wavelength range of the FLASH2 [2]. However, a critical issue linked to the success of the current HWS is the assumption of high transverse coherence of the radiation. We observed a slight difference between the retrieved focuses by the HWS and those measured with the imprints method. We attribute the observed difference to the low-degree of the transverse coherence. Recently, we performed a non-destructive Young’s double-pinhole experiment, at the beamline FL24, which proved the variation of the degree of transverse coherence (25-50% deviation from the full coherence) correlated to the various machine parameters [3]. Advances in the Fresnel Diffractive Imaging (FDI) have promoted the FEL pulse characterization by reconstructing partially coherent wave fields. This approach was successfully applied to characterize highly transverse coherent, focused pulses at the beamline BL2 at the FLASH1 line [4]. We have extended the application of the FDI method, at the beamline FL24, to characterize the transverse partially coherent pulses, in a single-shot basis, and estimate a measure of the degree of the transverse coherence. Summarily, we report on the results of our previous pulse and transverse coherence characterization experiments, and discuss the feasibility of each method as an on-line photon diagnostic. Furthermore, our future plan to apply the partially coherent ptychography method [5] for the wave field characterization will be discussed providing the results of start-to-end simulations.---------------------------------------- References and links: 1.
