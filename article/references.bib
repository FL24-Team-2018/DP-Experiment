  abstract  = {The concept of coherence is widely used in different areas of physics like in optics, in quantum optics or in neutron and X-ray scattering, however with subtle differences in meaning for the different communities. In quantum optics it is mainly the source of photons and its characterization in terms of coherence functions which is of concern. In a scattering experiment, on the other hand, the source is supposed to be characterized and it is the internal degrees of freedom of the sample which are studied via their influence on the detected interference pattern. It is one of the purposes of this paper to clarify the different concepts and to show how they are interrelated. The paper is organized as follows. First, we will discuss what interferes in a physical event. This will be treated according to the Feynman formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of probability amplitudes and we will describe nine rules on how to calculate with these amplitudes. Then we will discuss what destroys interference. The main part of the paper treats a number of applications from quantum optics and X-ray and neutron scattering. These include quantum beats, Hanbury Brown and Twiss interferometry, entangled states, Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen paradox and speckle from coherently illuminated samples. },

  abstract  = {Imaging experiments of ultrafast phenomena of matter at nanometre-scale require intense, short pulse duration and diffraction-limited soft–X-ray beams, nowadays almost only provided by free-electron lasers. Here, we focused on a table-top soft–X-ray source, which fulfils these fundamental criteria and in addition presents high temporal coherence, the high harmonics generated with a two-colour field (ω+2ω). These harmonics revealed to be free from aberration just by slightly spatially filtering the laser used for generation (ω). Indeed, the measured wavefront distortions, equal to λ/17 RMS at 44 nm, correspond to a diffraction-limited beam. This behaviour is explained by an additional spatial nonlinear filtering effect of the driving laser wavefront, induced here in our particular but simple geometrical configuration of generation by the 2ω component.},

It is shown that the XFEL radiation before saturation is described with Gaussian statistics. Particularly important is the case of the optimized XFEL studied in detail. Applying similarity techniques to the results of numerical simulations allowed us to find universal scaling relations for the main characteristics of an XFEL operating in the saturation regime: efficiency, coherence time and degree of transverse coherence. We find that with an appropriate normalization of these quantities, they are functions of only the ratio of the geometrical emittance of the electron beam to the radiation wavelength. Statistical and coherence properties of the higher harmonics of the radiation are highlighted as well.},

Double pinhole diffraction patterns of single femtosecond pulses focused to a size of about 10{\texttimes}10 $\mu$m2 were measured. A transverse coherence length of 6.2 {\textpm} 0.9 $\mu$m in the horizontal and 8.7 {\textpm} 1.0 $\mu$m in the vertical direction was determined from the most coherent pulses. Using a split and delay unit the coherence time of the pulses produced in the same operation conditions of FLASH was measured to be 1.75 {\textpm} 0.01 fs. From our experiment we estimated the degeneracy parameter of the FLASH beam to be on the order of 1010 to 1011, which exceeds the values of this parameter at any other source in the same energy range by many orders of magnitude.},

The distortion of the XRL wave-front caused by the gradients of the electron density is measured using Talbot pattern deformation. The plasma probed by the XRL is imaged on the CCD plane, then a 2D grating is put in front of the chip so that the Talbot plane of this grating fits on the CCD. The compromise between the spatial resolution and the sensitivity for the given wavelength of the probe must be set within the grating design. The main advantages of this method are low requirements on spatial coherence of the probing beam as well as the simple alignment, which are the main difficulties of interferometry using radiation of XRLs.},
