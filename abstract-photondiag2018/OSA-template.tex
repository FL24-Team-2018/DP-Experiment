\begin{abstract*}

Since 2016 FLASH at DESY in Hamburg operates the variable-gap undulator 
beamline FLASH2 as a user facility. Young's double pinhole measurements were 
performed at photon beamline FL24 downstream of the Kirkpatrick-Baez 
focusing optics, which were installed in 2017. FLASH2 was characterized at 
wavelengths of 8, 13.5 and 18 nm and under different machine settings. The
coherence length was determined from the interference pattern of several 
pinhole pair separations
covering the width of the beam. A blind deconvolution algorithm was 
implemented to determine
the coherence function from the partially coherent interference pattern. 
Simulations of the
patterns including the Kirkpatrick-Baez focusing optics were implemented 
with WavePropaGator (WPG), a software for X-ray wavefront propagation 
simulations developed at the European XFEL. We present first results of 
these coherence measurements and simulations.
